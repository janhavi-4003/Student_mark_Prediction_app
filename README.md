 # Project Title: Student Math Score Predictor using Machine Learning

#  Description:

This project is a regression-based Machine Learning application that predicts a student's Math score based on their personal, social, and academic background. The prediction model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input the following features through a web interface:

Gender (e.g., Male/Female)

Ethnic Group (e.g., Group A, B, C...)

Parental Education Level (e.g., Some high school, Associateâ€™s degree...)

Lunch Type (e.g., Standard or Free/Reduced)

Test Preparation Course (e.g., Completed or None)


Once the user selects values for these features, the application estimates and displays the predicted Math Score for that student. For example, a male student from Group A, whose parents had some high school education, who had standard lunch, and completed the test preparation course, receives a predicted Math Score of 69.28.

This project demonstrates how machine learning regression algorithms (like Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor) can be used in the education domain to analyze and predict student performance using categorical and numerical input data.
